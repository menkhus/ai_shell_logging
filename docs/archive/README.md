# Archive - Historical Planning Documents

These documents represent **completed work** from January 2026.
All functionality described has been implemented in the codebase.

**DO NOT USE FOR CONTEXT** - These are stale and will confuse analysis.
Refer to the main README.md and source code for current state.

## Contents

| File | Original Purpose | Status |
|------|------------------|--------|
| IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md | JSONL migration plan | ✓ Implemented |
| current_methodology_audit.md | Pre-migration audit | ✓ Historical |
| session_log_pattern_derived_from_claude.md | JSONL format spec | ✓ Implemented |
| todo_compare_tool_and_log_strategy.md | Architecture discussion | ✓ Resolved |

## Why Archived

These documents were useful during planning but now:
- Duplicate information in README.md and code
- Contain outdated recommendations (e.g., "remove claude wrapper")
- Will confuse LLMs trying to understand current system state
